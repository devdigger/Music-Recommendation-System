## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a personalized song recommendation system by analyzing the lyrics of songs. The system calculates the similarity between songs using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity techniques.

## Features

- Efficiently preprocesses and samples a large dataset of song lyrics.
- Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for converting song lyrics into a numerical representation.
- Calculates cosine similarity scores to determine the similarity between songs.
- Offers an object-oriented recommendation algorithm for personalized song suggestions.
- Demonstrates the system's capabilities with random and user-input song recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/devdigger/Music-Recommendation-System
cd Music-Recommendation-System
```
2. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the `songdata.csv` dataset in the project directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook using platforms like Google Colaboratory.
3. Follow the code comments to understand the project flow and functionality.

## Example

To see the recommendation system in action, run the provided Jupyter Notebook and follow the example code blocks to generate song recommendations based on specific songs or random selections.
